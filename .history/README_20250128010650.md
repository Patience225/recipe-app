Introduction
The Recipe App is a web-based application built to allow users to explore a variety of recipes, check ingredients and preparation steps, and view images of the final dishes. The app utilizes service workers to cache content for offline usage and improve performance. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to be responsive across various devices.

This project is perfect for users who are interested in exploring cooking options, saving their favorite recipes, and accessing them offline.

Features
Browse Recipes: The app displays a list of recipes, each containing the title, ingredients, preparation steps, and an image of the dish.
Offline Support: The app utilizes service workers to cache content for offline viewing. Users can access the recipes even without an internet connection.
Responsive Design: The layout is responsive, making it user-friendly on both mobile and desktop devices.
Favicon: A custom favicon is used to enhance the branding of the app.
Recipe Storage: Recipes are saved in a JSON file and dynamically loaded into the app.
Service Worker: Caching with service workers improves loading times and allows offline functionality.
Tech Stack
HTML: The structure and content of the web pages.
CSS: The styles for the layout and design, making the app responsive and visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used for handling dynamic content and interactions.
Service Workers: Provides caching and offline support.
JSON: Stores recipe data.
Installation
To get started with the Recipe App, follow the instructions below.

Prerequisites
You must have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to run the app.
A code editor (like VS Code) for viewing and editing the project files.
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd recipe-app
Open the index.html file in your browser:

You can open the file directly from the browser or use a local server for a better development experience.
Optional: Install a local server (for development purposes):

If you want to run the app using a local server for better handling of service workers and caching, you can use a tool like Live Server (VS Code extension) or http-server (Node.js package).
To install http-server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g http-server
Then, run the server in the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
http-server
Access the app: Open http://localhost:8080 (or the address provided by the server) in your browser to view the Recipe App.

Usage
Home Page: Upon loading, the app displays a list of available recipes with their names, images, ingredients, and preparation steps.

Offline Mode: After initial loading, the app will cache the content and allow you to access the recipes even when there is no internet connection.

Explore Recipes: Click on any recipe to view more details.
